Makefile-based build instructions for AllJoyn JavaScript binding
----------------------------------------------------------------

The makefile in this directory works only on Ubuntu x86.

OS=linux, CPU=x86 or CPU=x86-64 are the only configurations supported by this
Make build.  No attempt is made to support other platforms, as the SCons build
does.


Setup for Make build:
---------------------

You do not need Python, SCons, Doxygen, Uncrustify, etc to use this Make build.

1) Complete a makefile build of the AllJoyn "core", which will build the AllJoyn
   daemon executable and native-code client libraries for the target platform.
   Note the "OS" and "CPU" settings used in the Make command.

* For more information, see "../make-build_instructions.txt" or
* "alljoyn_core/make-build_instructions.top".

2) Install Xulrunner (Gecko) SDK.  The alljoyn_js build needs header files from
   the Xulrunner SDK. We recommend the same version of xulrunner-sdk for both 32
   and 64 bit Ubuntu:
   http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/3.6.27/sdk/xulrunner-3.6.27.en-US.linux-i686.sdk.tar.bz2.

3) Install Linux dependencies: packages libgtk2.0-dev, libssl-dev, and xsltproc
   (on Ubuntu).


How to run Make build:
---------------------

1) Execute make command: 

   make CPU=x86 OS=linux VARIANT=debug GECKO_BASE=<XulRunner_Install_Dir>

   where <XulRunner_Install_Dir> is the directory where you installed the Gecko SDK in step 2 above.


Browser Plugin file:
-------------------

A successful build will produce a browser plug-in file named libnpalljoyn.so.
This file needs to be copied into ~/.mozilla/plugins before starting the browser.


NOTE: The libnpalljoyn.so plugin file may contain a run-time reference to liballjoyn.so,
      the AllJoyn shared library produced by the AllJoyn "core" build.
      You can find out if it does by running
          ldd libnpalljoyn.so
      and looking for any reference to liballjoyn.so.
      If a reference to liballjoyn.so exists, then you will need to copy liballjoyn.so
      into ~/.mozilla/plugins, alongside libnpalljoyn.so.
      If no reference to liballjoyn.so was found, you do not need to install liballjoyn.so
      with the plugin.
