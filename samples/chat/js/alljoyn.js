             * that there can be only one endpoint for a multipoint session in a particular bus
             * attachment.  This endpoint can be created explicitly by a call to joinSession() or
             * implicitly by a call to bindSessionPort().  An attempt to call joinSession() on a
             * session port we have created with bindSessionPort() will result in an error.
             * 
             * When we call bindSessionPort(), we do an implicit joinSession() and thus signals
             * (which correspond to our chat messages) will begin to flow from the hosted chat
             * channel as soon as we begin to host a corresponding session.
             * 
             * To achieve sane user interface behavior, we need to block those signals from the
             * implicit join done by the bind until our user joins the bound chat channel.  If we do
             * not do this, the chat messages from the chat channel hosted by the application will
             * appear in the chat channel joined by the application.
             *
             * Since the messages flow automatically, we can accomplish this by turning a filter on
             * and off in the chat signal handler.  So if we detect that we are hosting a channel,
             * and we find that we want to join the hosted channel we turn the filter off.
             * 
             * We also need to be able to send chat messages to the hosted channel.  This means we
             * need to point the mChatInterface at the session ID of the hosted session.  There is
             * another complexity here since the hosted session doesn't exist until a remote session
             * has joined.  This means that we don't have a session ID to use in chat() until a
             * remote device does a joinSession on our hosted session.  This, in turn, means that we
             * have to remember the session ID when we get an onJoined() callback in the
             * SessionPortListener passed into bindSessionPort().
             * 
             * So, to summarize, these next few lines handle a relatively complex case.  When we
             * host a chat channel, we do a bindSessionPort which *enables* the creation of a
             * session.  As soon as a remote device joins the hosted chat channel, a session is
             * actually created, and the SessionPortListener onJoined() callback is fired.  At that
             * point, we remember the hosted session's sessionId that we can use to send chat
             * messages to the channel we are hosting.  As soon as the session comes up, we begin
             * receiving chat messages from the session, so we need to filter them until the user
             * joins the hosted chat channel.  In a separate timeline, the user can decide to join
             * the chat channel she is hosting.  She can do so either before or after the
             * corresponding session has been created as a result of a remote device joining the
             * hosted session.  If she joins the hosted channel before the underlying session is
             * created, her chat messages will be discarded.  If she does so after the underlying
             * session is created, there will be a session emitter waiting to use to send chat
             * messages.  In either case, the signal filter will be turned off in order to listen to
